\title{Per-SIMPER function adapted to overall dissimilarity analysis of 3 groups or more}
\usage{
PerSIMPER_overall(
  matrixSIMP,
  Groups,
  leg = FALSE,
  count = TRUE,
  dataTYPE = "prab",
  Nperm = 1000,
  plotSIMPER = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrixSIMP}{Sample/Taxa matrix with sample in row and taxa in column}

\item{Groups}{Grouping vector, ex : c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4) : 3 groups or more}

\item{leg}{Display the legend on PerSIMPER profile, default = FALSE}

\item{count}{Display the number of permutation done, can be usefull with very large or small matrix, default = TRUE}

\item{Nperm}{Number of permutation, default = 1000, should be change to 100 for robustness analysis}

\item{plotSIMPER}{Display the SIMPER, PerSIMPER and E index plots, default = TRUE}

\item{dataType}{Need to be set for presence/absence or abundance data ("count"), default = "prab" (presence_absence)}
}
\description{
This function is the basis of DNCI_ses_overall. Overall dissimilarity contribution of taxa is obtained by computing the mean contribution of pairwise dissimilarity of taxa for each pairs of assemblages. -Under development-
Qualitative identification of the main assembly process driving the overall dissimilarity contribution distribution (i.e. the empirical SIMPER profile structure). -Under development-
Similar to PerSIMPER() function, Groups need to be larger than 2.
}
\examples{
A <- PerSIMPER_overall(Matrix, Group)
#where Matrix is a presence/absence matrix with taxa in column and sample in row
#and Group is a vector with length() == number of rows/samples in Matrix, 3 groups or more.
#
B <- PerSIMPER_overall(Matrix, Group, Nperm = 100, count = FALSE, plotSIMPER = FALSE)
#In this example, same data are analysed, with 100 permutations, with no countdown and no plots
